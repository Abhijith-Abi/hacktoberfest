## 💼 Interview Questions & Answers

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: Why did you choose React for this project?**
**A:** I chose React because:
- Component-based architecture promotes code reusability
- Virtual DOM provides excellent performance
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Excellent developer tools and debugging capabilities
- Perfect for building interactive user interfaces
- Strong TypeScript support for future scaling

**Q: How did you handle state management?**
**A:** I used React's built-in state management with:
- `useState` hook for local component state
- `useEffect` hook for side effects and lifecycle management
- React Router for navigation state
- Context API for shared state (if applicable)
- Local storage for persistent data (booking forms)

**Q: How did you ensure responsive design?**
**A:** I implemented responsive design through:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Media queries for different screen sizes
- Mobile-first design approach
- Responsive images with multiple formats
- Touch-friendly interface elements

**Q: What performance optimizations did you implement?**
**A:** Key optimizations include:
- Code splitting with React.lazy() and Suspense
- Image optimization (AVIF, WebP formats)
- Webpack bundle optimization
- CSS and JavaScript minification
- Browser caching strategies
- Lazy loading for images and components

### **Project-Specific Questions**

**Q: Walk me through the booking system.**
**A:** The booking system includes:
- User-friendly form with validation
- Date and time selection
- Space type selection (office, meeting room, etc.)
- Contact information collection
- Form validation and error handling
- Confirmation and follow-up process

**Q: How did you structure the component hierarchy?**
**A:** The hierarchy follows this pattern:
- App.js (root component)
- AppRoutes.js (routing logic)
- Page components (Home, Services, etc.)
- Shared components (Navbar, Footer, etc.)
- Utility components (Preloader, ScrollIndicator)

**Q: What challenges did you face and how did you solve them?**
**A:** Main challenges included:
- **Routing:** Implemented React Router for SPA navigation
- **Performance:** Optimized images and implemented code splitting
- **User Experience:** Added preloaders and smooth transitions
- **Cross-browser compatibility:** Tested across different browsers
- **Mobile responsiveness:** Used CSS Grid and Flexbox

### **Behavioral Questions**

**Q: How did you approach this project?**
**A:** My approach was:
1. **Planning:** Analyzed requirements and created wireframes
2. **Architecture:** Designed component structure and data flow
3. **Development:** Built components incrementally
4. **Testing:** Tested each component and integration
5. **Optimization:** Improved performance and user experience
6. **Documentation:** Created comprehensive documentation

**Q: What would you improve if you had more time?**
**A:** Future improvements would include:
- Backend integration for real booking functionality
